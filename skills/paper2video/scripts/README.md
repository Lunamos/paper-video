# scripts/

Pipeline tools for the Remotion project. Run them from the project root (the folder holding
`scenes.json`) or set `PAPER_VIDEO_ROOT`. Python 3.10+, standard library only; `numpy`,
`edge-tts` and `faster-whisper` are pulled in automatically through `uv run --with ...` when a
step needs them (`figdata.py` is run with `uv run --with pymupdf ...` as in its usage line). `ffmpeg`/`ffprobe` must be on PATH. Keys are read from the environment or `.env`
and are never printed.

| Script | Purpose | Key? | Example |
|---|---|---|---|
| `vo.py` | Voice-over: one read per scene -> tighten pauses, min gaps, polish, normalise -> `public/audio/<cut>/*.mp3` + `public/data/vo.<cut>.json` (+ `notes/vo_report.<cut>.json`). Backends: `elevenlabs`, `edge`, `recorded`, `none` | only for `elevenlabs` | `python3 scripts/vo.py build --lang en` |
| `vo.py audition` | Same short text in several voices, with QA numbers | only for `elevenlabs` | `python3 scripts/vo.py audition --lang en --backend edge --voices a=en-US-AndrewNeural,b=en-US-AvaNeural` |
| `voice_qa.py` | Prosody stats (YIN pitch variation, pauses) + ASR round-trip (Scribe with a key, else local faster-whisper) | no (optional) | `python3 scripts/voice_qa.py public/audio/en/s_intro.mp3 --text "..." --asr` |
| `music.py` | Music bed composed per music section (ElevenLabs), or level your own royalty-free track -> `public/audio/bgm_<cut>.mp3` at -17.4 LUFS; `--refit` re-times the generated bed after a voice-over change (no credits) | only to generate | `python3 scripts/music.py --lang en --refit` |
| `sfx_synth.py` | Procedural SFX (whoosh, pop, tick, hit, stamp, shimmer, riser, powerdown) -> `public/audio/sfx/` | no | `python3 scripts/sfx_synth.py` |
| `srt.py` | Captions as `.srt` (same paging as the burned-in captions; CJK-style for zh/ja) | no | `python3 scripts/srt.py zh` |
| `timeline_info.py` | Scene start frames, durations and anchor frames (as `timeline.ts` computes them) | no | `python3 scripts/timeline_info.py en` |
| `zh_font_subset.py` | Local CJK font subset of exactly the characters used -> `public/fonts/zh/`, `src/theme/fonts-zh.json` | no | `python3 scripts/zh_font_subset.py` |
| `review.py` | Review stills: every anchor (once its beat has settled) plus scene starts/ends, rendered with one bundle (`stills.mjs`) and tiled into contact sheets per scene or for the film | no | `python3 scripts/review.py VIDEO-ZH zh --scenes s_method` |
| `vreview.py` | Contact sheets of the vertical scenes (`V-<Name>` previews) at every anchor, one sheet per scene | no | `python3 scripts/vreview.py --scenes s_intro,s_end` |
| `zh_breaks.py` | Chinese word boundaries (jieba) for the vertical captions → `public/data/zh_breaks.json`; re-run after each Chinese voice build | no | `uv run --with jieba python scripts/zh_breaks.py` |
| `stills.mjs` | Many stills of one composition from a single bundle (used by `review.py`) | no | `node scripts/stills.mjs VIDEO-EN out/stills 120,480,900 --scale 0.5` |
| `contact_sheet.py` | Tile rendered stills into one review image | no | `python3 scripts/contact_sheet.py out/sheet.png out/stills/*.png` |
| `figdata.py` | Numbers from figure files: `dump` (vector PDF paths + labels), `images` (embedded raster panels), `heatmap` (colormap inversion of cells + their text), `markers` (digitise line+marker plots, overlay for checking) | no | `uv run --with pymupdf python scripts/figdata.py dump figs/fig3.pdf` |
| `finalize.sh` | Render a composition, two-pass loudnorm to -14 LUFS / -1.5 dBTP, AAC 320k 48 kHz, optional cover still | no | `scripts/finalize.sh VIDEO-EN video_en Cover-EN` |
| `finalize_vertical.sh` | Same for a 1080x1920 cut, plus vertical cover stills | no | `scripts/finalize_vertical.sh VIDEO-Vertical video_zh_v Cover-ZH-3x4 Cover-ZH-9x16` |
| `verify.py` | Check a finished file: streams, duration vs timeline, loudness, full-mix ASR vs script + key terms (local whisper by default), full-frame motion runs (zoom/drift/jitter) -> `notes/verify.<name>.json` | no (optional) | `python3 scripts/verify.py out/video_en.mp4 --cut en` |
| `export_handoff.py` | For editing apps: silent picture (+ per-scene clips), voice/music/sfx stems, SRT, scene CSV, CMX3600 EDL | no | `python3 scripts/export_handoff.py VIDEO-EN --lang en --per-scene` |
| `new_video.sh` | Workspace mode: create a video folder from the template + scripts, linked to the workspace's shared `node_modules` and `.env` (copy this script to the workspace root, next to the shared `package.json`) | no | `./new_video.sh "Paper X video"` |
| `common.py` | Shared helpers (root, keys, loudness, timeline maths, uv runner) | - | imported |

      "en": { "minSeconds": 10, "leadInMs": 400, "tailMs": 500, "pick": "steady",
              "lines": [ { "id": "a", "text": "Caption text (shown).", "tts": "[curious] Spoken text (tags, respellings).",
                           "anchors": { "beat": "word" }, "pauseAfterMs": 400 } ] },
      "zh": { "lines": [ ... ] } }
  ]
}
```

- `text` is what the captions show; `tts` (optional, defaults to `text`) is what is spoken. Timings
  are aligned from `tts` onto `text`, so respellings (`twenty` for `20`) keep captions exact.
- `anchors`: name -> word (latin: first matching word) or substring (CJK); the template turns them
  into frames so animations land on the spoken word.
- Audio tags (`[curious]`, `[excited]`, `[chuckles]` ...) only reach ElevenLabs v3; other backends strip them.
- `recorded`: put narration at `recordings/<cut>/<scene_id>.wav|mp3|m4a|flac`.
- `notes/vo_picks.<cut>.json` (`{"s_intro": 23}`) pins an ElevenLabs take by seed.
- `keyTerms` (voice or scene block): accepted spellings joined by `|` (`"熵|商"` when `tts` respells a rare
  character); compared by count between the spoken text and the ASR transcript.
- `chapter` names the video chapter (caption pill, YouTube/Bilibili chapters); `musicSection` groups scenes
  into music sections for `music.py` (defaults to `chapter`), so the music can change less often than chapters.

## Limitations

- ASR error counts spelled-out numbers vs digits as mismatches; compare takes relatively.
- `edge` uses an unofficial Microsoft endpoint (free, may change or rate-limit); one take per scene.
- `export_handoff.py` needs the template's `mute` prop; stem renders take roughly as long as a video render.
- `music.py --file` does not loop a track shorter than the video.
